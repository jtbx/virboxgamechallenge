My entry to the 1st Virbox coding challenge.

This is a simple text-based game that runs in
your terminal using the curses library, which
helps make games like these. For more information,
see the commment at the top of main.d.

To play this game, you need to first compile it.
Since it is written in D, you must install make
and ldc (the LLVM D compiler) first. Both should
be in most Linux package repositories. If you're
using Nix, you can enter a temporary shell with
all required dependencies by running `nix-shell`.

To build, run `make` in the directory with the
source code. The resulting executable will be
called "virboxquest". To run it, just type
`./virboxquest` into your shell.
